# PyDui Introduction

**PyDui base on GTK-3, PyGObject**

Even though there is GTK/Glade can quickly and efficiently build a powerful UI Application. But the Glade is not easy enough to learn. Sometimes, we need another solution for rapidly building a simple app. I think, on the windows platform, DuiLib is an option because it's easy to learn.

**Why not just wrap the DuiLib API ?** 
This is a good question because DuiLib only works on windows. And the author work on mac. So, this is not for cross-platform purposes, just personal reasons.



# Code Example

```python
# TODO: hey? 
```
